### Score-based diffusion models

Diffusion models are deep hierarchical models for data that use neural networks to model the reverse of a diffusion process that adds a sequence of noise perturbations to the data. 

Modern cutting-edge diffusion models (see citations) express both the forward and reverse diffusion processes as a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE).

*A diagram (see citations) showing how to map data to a noise distribution (the prior) with an SDE, and reverse this SDE for generative modeling. One can also reverse the associated probability flow ODE, which yields a deterministic process that samples from the same distribution as the SDE. Both the reverse-time SDE and probability flow ODE can be obtained by estimating the score.* 
<!-- $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}} \log p_t(\boldsymbol{x}_t)$ -->

-----

For any SDE of the form 

$$
\text{d}\boldsymbol{x} = f(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\text{d}t + g(t)\text{d}\boldsymbol{w},
$$

the reverse of the SDE from noise to data is given by 

$$
\text{d}\boldsymbol{x} = [f(\boldsymbol{x}, t) - g(t)^2\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\log p_t(\boldsymbol{x})]\text{d}t + g(t)\text{d}\boldsymbol{w}.
$$

For every SDE there exists an associated ordinary differential equation (ODE)

$$
\text{d}\boldsymbol{x} = [f(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\text{d}t - \frac{1}{2}g(t)^2\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\log p_t(\boldsymbol{x})]\text{d}t,
$$

where the trajectories of the SDE and ODE have the same marginal PDFs $p_t(\boldsymbol{x})$.

The Stein score of the marginal probability distributions over $t$ is approximated with a neural network $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\log p_t(\boldsymbol{x})\approx s_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}(t), t)$. The parameters of the neural network are fit by minimising the score-matching loss.

### Computing log-likelihoods with diffusion models

For each SDE there exists a deterministic ODE with marginal likelihoods $p_t(\boldsymbol{x})$ that match the SDE for all time $t$

$$
\text{d}\boldsymbol{x} = [f(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\text{d}t - \frac{1}{2}g(t)^2\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\log p_t(\boldsymbol{x})]\text{d}t = F(\boldsymbol{x}(t), t).
$$

The continuous normalizing flow formalism allows the ODE to be expressed as

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log p(\boldsymbol{x}(t)) = -\text{Tr}\bigg [ \frac{\partial}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}(t)} F(\boldsymbol{x}(t), t) \bigg ],
$$

but note that maximum-likelihood training is prohibitively expensive for SDE based diffusion models.

### Usage

Install via

```
pip install sbgm
```

See [examples](https://github.com/homerjed/sbgm/tree/main/examples).

To run on the `cifar10` image dataset, try something like

```python
import sbgm
import data
import configs

datasets_path = "."
root_dir = "."

config = configs.cifar10_config()

key = jr.key(config.seed)
data_key, model_key, train_key = jr.split(key, 3)

dataset = data.cifar10(datasets_path, data_key)

sharding = sbgm.shard.get_sharding()
    
# Diffusion model 
model = sbgm.models.get_model(
    model_key, 
    config.model.model_type, 
    dataset.data_shape, 
    dataset.context_shape, 
    dataset.parameter_dim,
    config
)

# Stochastic differential equation (SDE)
sde = sbgm.sde.get_sde(config.sde)

# Fit model to dataset
model = sbgm.train.train(
    train_key,
    model,
    sde,
    dataset,
    config,
    reload_opt_state=False,
    sharding=sharding,
    save_dir=root_dir
)
```

### Features

* Parallelised exact and approximate log-likelihood calculations,
* UNet and transformer score network implementations,
* VP, SubVP and VE SDEs (neural network $\beta(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$ functions are on the list!),
* Multi-modal conditioning (basically just optional parameter and image conditioning methods),
* Checkpointing optimiser and model,
* Multi-device training and sampling.

### Samples

> [!NOTE]
> I haven't optimised any training/architecture hyperparameters or trained long enough here, you could do a lot better.
